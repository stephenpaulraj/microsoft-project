:::tip Answer  
Azure Automation now ships with the Azure PowerShell module of version 0.8.6, which introduced the ability to non-interactively authenticate to Azure using OrgId
(Azure Active Directory user) credential-based authentication. Using the steps below, you can set up Azure Automation to talk to Azure using this authentication type.  
**Step 1:** Find the Azure Active Directory associated with the Azure subscription to manage:  
1.Log in to the Azure portal as the service administrator for the Azure subscription you want to manage using Azure Automation. You can find this user by logging in to the Azure portal as any user with access to this Azure subscription, then clicking Settings, then Administrators.

![](https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0030700002.jpg)  
**Step 2:** Create an Azure Active Directory user in the directory associated with the Azure subscription to manage:
You can skip this step if you already have an Azure Active Directory user in this directory. and plan to use this OrgId to manage Azure.  
1.In the Azure portal click on Active Directory service.
![](https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0030800001.jpg)  
2.Click the directory name that is associated with this Azure subscription.  
3.Click on the Users tab and then click the Add User button.  
4.For type of user, select ג€New user in your organization.ג€ Enter a username for the user to create.  
5.Fill out the user's profile. For role, pick ג€User.ג€ Don't enable multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor accounts cannot be used with Azure Automation.  
6.Click Create.  
7.Jot down the full username (including part after @ symbol) and temporary password.  
**Step 3:** Allow this Azure Active Directory user to manage this Azure subscription.  
1.Click on Settings (bottom Azure tab under StorSimple)
![](https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0030900001.jpg)  
2.Click Administrators   
3.Click the Add button. Type the full user name (including part after @ symbol) of the Azure Active Directory user you want to set up to manage Azure. For subscriptions, choose the Azure subscriptions you want this user to be able to manage. Click the check mark.  
**Step 4:** Configure Azure Automation to use this Azure Active Directory user to manage this Azure subscription
Create an Azure Automation credential asset containing the username and password of the Azure Active Directory user that you have just created. You can create a credential asset in Azure Automation by clicking into an Automation Account and then clicking the Assets tab, then the Add Setting button.

**Overview -**  
Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch offices.

**Existing Environment -**  

**Application Architecture -**  
The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.  
Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than 80 live code branches in the application's code base.  
The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS proxy servers.

**Architectural Issues -**  
Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to individual developers.  
Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.  
Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually. The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.

**Requirements -**  

**Planned Changes -**  
Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund management system.  
The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by customers.  
Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a series of packages.  
Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services whenever suitable.
Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug reports.  

**Technical Requirements -**  
The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:  
New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.  
Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.  
The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.  
A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.  
Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions of package feeds.  
Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and device types in use.  
By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which must be kept for 60 days.  
Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.  
The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic authentication over HTTPS.  
The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.  

**Current Technical Issue -**  
The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.  
Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to individual developers.  
Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.  
Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually. The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.

**Requirements -**  

**Planned Changes -**   
Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund management system.  
The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by customers.  
Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a series of packages.  
Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services whenever suitable.
Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug reports.

**Technical Requirements -**  
The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:  
New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.  
Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.  
The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.  
A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.  
Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions of package feeds.  
Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and device types in use.  
By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which must be kept for 60 days.  
Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.  
The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic authentication over HTTPS.  
The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.  

**Current Technical Issue -**  
The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.  
Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

**Overview -**  
Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch offices.

**Existing Environment -**  

**Application Architecture -**  
The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.  
Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than 80 live code branches in the application's code base.  
The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS proxy servers.

**Architectural Issues -**  
Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to individual developers.  
Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.  
Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually. The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.

**Requirements -**  

**Planned Changes -**  
Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund management system.  
The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by customers.  
Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a series of packages.  
Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services whenever suitable.
Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug reports.  

**Technical Requirements -**  
The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:  
New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.  
Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.  
The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.  
A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.  
Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions of package feeds.  
Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and device types in use.  
By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which must be kept for 60 days.  
Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.  
The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic authentication over HTTPS.  
The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.  

**Current Technical Issue -**  
The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.  
Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

![](https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04257/0012200001.jpg)

**Question**

**To resolve the current technical issue, what should you do to the Register-AzureRmAutomationDscNode command?**

1. A. Change the value of the ConfigurationMode parameter.
2. B. Replace the Register-AzureRmAutomationDscNode cmdlet with Register-AzureRmAutomationScheduledRunbook
3. C. Add the AllowModuleOverwrite parameter.
4. D. Add the DefaultProfile parameter.

The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.  

**Current Technical Issue -**  
The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.  
Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

**Overview -**  
Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch offices.

**Existing Environment -**  

**Application Architecture -**  
The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.  
Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than 80 live code branches in the application's code base.  
The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS proxy servers.

**Architectural Issues -**  
Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to individual developers.  
Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.  
Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually. The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.

**Requirements -**  

**Planned Changes -**  
Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund management system.  
The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by customers.  
Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a series of packages.  
Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services whenever suitable.
Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug reports.  

**Technical Requirements -**  
The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:  
New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.  
Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.  
The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.  
A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.  
Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions of package feeds.  
Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and device types in use.  
By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which must be kept for 60 days.  
Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
